Gold Price Predictor Project
Overview:
Project: Using historical data, this machine learning project aims to predict the price of gold. Based on a variety of input features, this project offers a predictive model for estimating future gold prices by utilising the scikit-learn Random Forest Regressor algorithm in Python.

Qualities:
1. Data Analysis: The project conducts thorough data analysis using pandas and numpy, looking for patterns and relationships in the dataset.
2. Visualisation: To help with understanding patterns and correlations, matplotlib and seaborn are used to visualise important trends and insights in the gold price data.
3. Model Development: To forecast future gold prices, the Random Forest Regressor model is trained on historical price data. Sklearn provides the required tools for model training and
4. Evaluation Metrics: The trained model's performance is evaluated using the metrics module from sklearn, which offers metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared score.
5. Deployment: The trained model can be used to make predictions in real time, providing analysts and investors with a useful tool to help them make wise decisions in the gold market.
